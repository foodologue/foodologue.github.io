    <h2>Why this guide?</h2>
    <p>I love eating out and sampling different cuisines. The authenticity of each
        place one eats at is not entirely guaranteed, so I tend to sample multiple
        restaurants claiming to serve a particular cuisine, especially when I haven't tried the food 
        in the country of its origin. I hope you like some of those
        which have made this list.</p>
