        <li> <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/takenorirestaurant/?hl=en"> Takenori</a>: Japanese restaurant on Simon-Dach-Straße. I relished their Katsu Curry and would often
            spend my first paycheck as an intern there!

        <li><a href="https://pest.vakvarju.com/etlap/">VakVarjú Restaurant:</a>
        Located on the West of Danube in Pest, I really liked the 
        Madártej (Bird's Milk), a dessert made with egg whites! Very close to the St. Stephen's Basilica.
        I highly reccommend trying out the Túrógombóc (cottage cheese with sour creme), but I cannot recall the restaurant I had them.
        The food was authentic according to a couple of locals. 
        <li> <a href="https://espressoembassy.hu/">Espresso Embassy:</a> I enjoyed
        the coffee there as well as the general ambience. Thought I might mention this for future reference!</li>
